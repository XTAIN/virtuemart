These are the build scripts for VirtueMart
You will need them to build installable archives out of the CVS sources.

7-zip
----------
You need to install 7zip in order to use them.

Windows Version: http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=14481
These scripts were tested successfully with 7zip version 4.20

Linux Version: http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=111810
These scripts were tested successfully with p7zip version 4.20 and 4.29

About the scripts
---------------------
There are two basic versions of the script: 

	* one for building just the component installer file
		( build_component.bat / .sh )
		
	* one for building the COMPLETE PACKAGE, including Mambots, Modules and the Language Pack
		( build_virtuemart_complete.bat / .sh )


Adjust the scripts!!
---------------------
After you have installed 7zip, you must change the paths to your CVS repository
in the scripts.
You must change these parts (FILL IN YOUR LOCAL PATHS!):


Windows (*.bat):
##########
rem ... WHERE ARE THE CVS SOURCES LOCATED?
set CVS_PATH="C:\downloads\Joomla\virtuemart\"

rem ... The Path to 7Zip
set zip=c:\programme\7-zip\7z.exe
##########



Linux (*.sh):
##########
# ... The Path to your CVS Repository
CVS_PATH=/home/soeren/Joomla/virtuemart/CVS/virtuemart

# ... The Path were the build directory is located...
BUILD_PATH=/home/soeren/Joomla/virtuemart/build
##########
