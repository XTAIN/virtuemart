        <para>VirtueMart is a Shopping Cart Application for selling goods over
        the internet. It's a Component (<emphasis>= plugin</emphasis>) for a
        Content Management System called Joomla! (and Mambo) and can't be used
        without Joomla!. It installs fairly easy using the automatic Component
        and Module installer. It's intended for use in small / mid-sized
        Online businesses / Online-Shops. So every user who wants to build up
        a Online Store can use this component for selling something to
        customers.</para>

      <para>VirtueMart is a simple Online-Shop application. But it is surely
      no "out-of-the-box" killer application for professional companies. It's
      not tested in 100% secure environments. It's not meant to be 100%
      performant.</para>

      <para>You will need some time to customize this application to fit your
      needs.</para>

      <para>Be prepared to be confronted with bugs, which have currently not
      been found yet. VirtueMart has an active community and a forum where
      problems and questions can be discussed. (<ulink

    <para>This tutorial will walk you through the setup of your site, ongoing
    management, and advanced administration accessed via the VirtueMart
    administrative interface.</para>

    <para>It assumes that you have already installed and configured your site
    (VirtueMart 1.1 with Joomla! 1.0.12).</para>

    <para>VirtueMart allows you to select "Simple Layout" and "Extended
    Layout". The simple layout is the standard layout and provides a basic
    cross-browser-safe layout. The extended layout instead uses the fabulous
    ExtJS library for creating a nested layout that allows better presentation
    of the administrative functions of VirtueMart. So it opens items for
    editing in a new tab inside the main panel. It should work fine on
    Internet Explorer 6+, Firefox 2+, Opera 9+ and Safari 2+.</para>

        Manufacturers" to see a list of all manufacturers. You may also get to
        this screen by clicking on the linked text, "Manufacturer List", in
        the Manufacturers column on the Manufacturer Category List
        screen.</para>

        <para>Click on the name of the manufacturer you would like to edit, or
        click on the linked text "update" in the Admin column - either will
        take you to the same Manufacturer Add Information form. Make your
        changes in the Manufacturer "Add Information" form (described above),
        and click on the "Save" icon. You will be returned to the Manufacturer
        List screen.</para>

        <bridgehead>Deleting Manufacturers</bridgehead>

        <para>Before deleting an existing manufacturer, all products
        associated to that manufacturer must be removed through either
        deletion or re-association to another manufacturer. VirtueMart will
        not allow the deletion of a manufacturerwhile these child records
        still exist for that manufacturer.</para>

        <para>Once these child records have been removed, select "Manufacturer
        | List Manufacturers" to see a list of all manufacturer. Then click on
        the name of the manufacturer you would like to delete. In the
        Manufacturer Add Information form, click on the "Remove" icon. You
        will be returned to the Manufacturer List screen.</para>

        <para>Once this manufacturer has been deleted, it is removed from the
        system. To recover this manufacturer, you must re-create the
        manufacturer information, and re-associate all appropriate
        products.</para>

      <para>VirtueMart offers the ability to categorize products not only by

      contain subcategories enabling storekeepers to manage their products in
      as much detail as possible. Because products and product categories are
      associated to a particular vendor, it is important to create your vendor
      records before creating the product and product category records.</para>

          <title>Removing Product Categories</title>

          <para>Before deleting an existing product category, all sub
          categories associated to the product category must be removed
          through either deletion or re-association. VirtueMart will not allow
          the deletion of a product category while subcategories still exist
          for that product category.</para>

          <para>Categories can be removed from the store although they contain
          products. If products are assigned to more than one category, those
          products won't be removed if you delete just one category. But if a
          product is just assigned to one category, it will be deleted if you
          delete its category.</para>

          <para>Removing a category can be done by clicking the "trash bin"
          icon in the last column of each row in the product category list.
          But you can also click the checkboxes of the categories you want to
          remove and click the "Remove" button in the toolbar.</para>

        <title>Products</title>

        <para>When creating your product records, it is important to make a
        distinction as to whether the product that is being created can be
        uniquely identified by its nature or name (e.g. Compact Disks, Video
        Cassettes, Books, etc.), or is one of many similar items that are
        uniquely identified by their attributes (e.g. Apparel, Furniture,
        Automobiles, etc.). The reason this distinction needs to be made, is
        because the methods for creating, editing and deleting differ for
        each. Items require the creation of Item Attributes, but products do
        not.</para>

          form and click the Save button in the top right corner to save the

          <para>When Updating a product, just click on the Product Name in the

        VirtueMart is a pre-defined variation on the main product. In order to

        <para>To create a new item, a parent product must exist / be created

        specific item is selected by the customer, the product information,
        product dimensions, and product images for that item will be
        displayed. Next, the attributes that will be used to identify the
        items need to be created. Open the Product Form of the Parent Item you
        create in the first step. <screenshot>

      <para>VirtueMart comes with an extended User Management compared to
      Joomla's User Management Features.</para>

      <important>
        <para>Always use the VirtueMart User Manager for Adding / Editing and
        Deleting Users to / from your Joomla! site! If you use Joomla's
        built-in User Manager you will run into troubles because important
        database entries are not created for such users. So for the other
        case: When you delete Users with the Joomla! User Manager from the
        site that have been added with the VirtueMart User Manager, you will
        have a lot of useless database entries.</para>
      </important>

      <para>VirtueMart also provides the ability to create any number of

      well.</para>

        <title>Shopper Groups</title>

        <para>VirtueMart offers the ability to not only manage users by
        vendor, but also by shopper group. This enables storekeepers to create
        shopper groups for whatever need (e.g. site access, customer rating,
        tax display, etc.). These shopper groups can then be used to provide
        special services, discounts, or access to a specific group of users.
        Because users and shopper groups are associated to a particular
        vendor, it is important to create your vendor records before creating
        the user and shopper group records.</para>

        <note>
          <para>There's only one "default" shopper group. Whatever shopper
          group you set as default, its settings are used for new customers.

        <para>User Groups are "Permission Groups" and used to restrict access

        <para><emphasis role="bold">When can this be useful?</emphasis>
        Imagine you have a user, who wants to access the "Report" section of
        the store. Usually this is restricted to admins and stoeradmins. If
        you assign this user to the admin/storeadmin group, he will also be
        able to access other sensible parts of the store, where he could
        change or delete important data. The solution is to add a new User
        Group called "Report", which will have the same permissions as
        shoppers PLUS access to the "report" core module. After the Group has
        been added, you can assign this user to the new group.</para>

        <para>THIS PART OF VirtueMart STILL IS NOT COMPLETE. IT'S NOT
        RECOMMENDED TO USE THIS FEATURE.</para>
      </warning>

      <para>Vendors and Vendor Categories represent the top most tier of
      VirtueMart administration. Through vendor administration, the store
      keeper is able to manage products, users, and orders by vendor or
      supplier.</para>

      <para>[TODO - heirarchial drawing]</para>

      <para>For simple stores where there are only a few products offered,
      vendor administration is not necessarily needed, but for larger more
      complex stores, such as an online mall, vendor administration can be
      essential.</para>

      <para>Since all products, product categories, users, and orders are
      associated to the vendor record, establishing the vendor and vendor
      category structure is the first step to building the online
      store.</para>

      <para>Note that it is not necessary to create the vendor categories
      first. Vendors can be re-associated to vendor categories after all the
      vendor records have been created. However, creating the vendor category
      records first can save some extra work if you already know how you want
      to categorize your vendors.</para>

      <para></para>

      <section id="Vendor_Categories" lang="">
        <title>Vendor Categories</title>

        <para>Vendor categories are a way to classify the types of goods and
        services that vendors offer on your site. For example, you may have an
        online mall for buying and selling furniture. You may want to create
        vendor categories such as "Antiques", "Office Furniture", and "Patio
        Furniture".</para>

        <para>Note that a vendor on your site can only be associated with a
        single vendor category, so it is important to use categories that are
        broad enough to represent the shopper's choice of storefronts. For
        example, "Antique Furniture" and "Vintage Clothing" would not be broad
        enough categories if you have a vendor that sells both types of items.
        In this case, you might want to use "Antiques" as your vendor
        category.</para>

        <para>VirtueMart creates the vendor category name "-default-" upon
        installation. It is not necessary to change this unless you choose to
        fully utilize the vendor category functionality.</para>

          <para>The Vendor Category List can be accessed in the Vendor Menu

        <para>Vendors are the main organizational factor in VirtueMart.
        Products and product categories, billing options, etc. are all
        configured per-vendor.</para>

        <para>Upon installation, a global, default vendor is created. This
        special case cannot be deleted, and is managed separately via the
        "Store | Edit Store" menu option.</para>

        <para>If you are running a shopping site for a single vendor (for
        example, if you are the only vendor that will be offering products in
        your store) then there is no need to create additional vendors. If,
        however, you will be running an online mall site that will be host to
        several vendors, then create one vendor account for each storefront
        owner.</para>

        <para>It may be worth noting here that you should not confuse vendors
        with manufacturers. A single vendor may have a different manufacturer
        for each product that they offer. If the person supplying the products
        on your site will be managing their own shipping, etc., then they are
        a vendor. If you will be managing these aspects, then the supplier is
        a manufacturer. (See Manufacturer Administration for more information

          <para>Click on the name of the vendor you would like to edit, or
          click on the linked text "update" in the Admin column - either will
          take you to the same Vendor Add Information form. Make your changes
          in the Vendor "Add Information" form (described above), and click on

          <important>
            <para>Since vendors represent the top most tier of site
            management, deletion of vendors should be avoided unless
            absolutely necessary.</para>
          </important>

          <para>Before deleting an existing vendor, all products, product
          categories, users, and orders associated to that vendor must be
          removed through either deletion or re-association to another vendor.
          VirtueMart will not allow the deletion of a vendor while these child
          records still exist for that vendor.</para>

          <para>Once these child records have been removed, select "Vendor |
          List Vendors" to see a list of all vendors. Then click on the name
          of the vendor you would like to delete. In the Vendor Add
          Information form, click on the "Remove" icon. You will be returned
          to the Vendor List screen.</para>

          <para>Once this vendor has been deleted, it is removed from the
          system. To recover this vendor, you must re-create the vendor
          information, and re-associate all appropriate product categories and

        <para>It is wise first of all to think about how you will charge for

        weight.</para>

        <para></para>

        <para>Not only do you need to think about shipping rates, but also
        shipping methods. Will you offer more than one shipping method – eg.

        Mail?</para>

        <para></para>

        <para>Even if you decide to only use one company for all of your

      <para>The area of <emphasis>payment processing</emphasis> can get a bit
      complicated, and it might be best to leave this to your web designer to
      sort out if possible. If you are able to use one of the payment
      processing companies that are already supported by VirtueMart, it will
      make life a lot easier (you will need to sign-up with a payment
      processor yourself – the program won’t do that for you!). You can see
      the options available by clicking on the <emphasis>‘List Payment
      Methods’</emphasis> icon on the store summary, or by selecting ‘List
      Payment Methods’ from the ‘Store’ menu.</para>

        <para><emphasis>Payment Method List</emphasis></para>

        <para></para>

        <para>It is possible to create a new payment method (there is a ‘New’
        toolbar button), but you may to hack the VirtueMart code in order to
        make use of it (not for the faint-hearted!)</para>

        <para></para>

        <para>The configuration options for each payment method are different
        – depending on what is required by that payment service provider.
        Usually your payment service provider will give you some kind of code,
        key, or user name which needs to be entered in the <emphasis>Payment
        Method Editor</emphasis>.</para>

        <para></para>

        <para>The Payment Method Editor consists of 2 tabs – the first of
        which you will probably not need to touch. The next Figure shows the
        2nd tab (‘Configuration’), which varies depending on the payment
        service provider, and the example shown here is for WorldPay.</para>

        <para></para>

        <para>Some payment processors will allow you to specify a script to be
        run on successful completion of a payment. Such a script could be used
        to <emphasis>automatically update the order status</emphasis> in
        VirtueMart so that you don’t have to manually tie up all of your
        online receipts with your product orders.</para>

        <para>Another advantage of this process is that when you're selling
        downloadable files, you don't have to set the Order Status that
        enables the Download (this sends out the Download-ID email) manually.
        This is done automatically by the script.</para>

        <para>See the Section "Pre-Configured Payment Methods" for more
        details on specific payment gateways.</para>

        <para>Other payment service providers may use different methods of
        automatically notifying you when a payment is received. Again, it is
        probably easiest to get your web designer to sort out the requirements
        for this, but if you need to do it yourself, check with your payment
        service provider as to what their requirements are. Often, automatic
        notification is referred to as <emphasis>‘IPN’ or ‘Instant Payment
        Notification’</emphasis>.</para>

      <title>The Documentation</title>

      <para>This documentation was written using <ulink
      url="http://www.xmlmind.com/xmleditor">XMLMind XML Editor</ulink> using
      the <ulink url="http://www.docbook.org">DocBook</ulink> XML
      Format.</para>

      <para>DocBook defines a set of markup elements useful for marking up
      text so that the text can then be transformed into several different
      formats. It's possible to create documents in different formats: PDF,
      HTML, HTML Help (.chm Files for Windows Help), XML, RTF, TeX, WordML
      (Word 2003) and others. The author of this document uses <ulink
      url="http://docbook.e-novative.de/">eDE</ulink> for generating the
      End-User documents. The idea is to write just once and reach the largest
      possible number of people with the information. Digital information not
      stored properly tends to get lost. Due to the fact that not containing
      uncommon characters (such as binary formats) it's possible to index and
      search directly on the documents written on SGML and consequently on
      DocBook. The SGML systems use markups to make their description. DocBook
      holds over 300 markup elements each one with several attributes which
      can assume several values, these can be fixed or defined by the document
      / style that the author has used.</para>
